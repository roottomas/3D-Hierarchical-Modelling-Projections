# WebGL Tank Project (JavaScript & Shaders)

This project is an interactive **WebGL application** developed in **JavaScript**, featuring a fully controllable tank built using **hierarchical modeling** and rendered with custom **WebGL shaders**.

## Overview
The application simulates a 3D tank that can be controlled via keyboard input, rendered from multiple camera views and projection types. The project focuses on **scene graphs**, **3D transformations**, and **real-time rendering concepts**.

## Key Features
- Hierarchical tank modeling using a **scene graph**
- Real-time control of tank parts (cabin, cannon, wheels)
- Multiple camera views and projection modes:
  - Front, top, left, and axonometric/oblique views
  - Parallel and perspective projections
- Dynamic viewport rendering for single and multi-view modes
- Tomato projectile system with physics-based motion
- Chequered ground plane rendered using geometric primitives

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
- WebGL programming and shader usage
- JavaScript-based scene graph implementation
- Hierarchical transformations and matrix composition
- Camera systems and projection mathematics
- Interactive input handling and real-time rendering
- Basic physics integration (Euler method)

## Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates strong understanding of **computer graphics fundamentals**, low-level WebGL rendering, and the ability to build interactive 3D applications without external libraries—skills directly applicable to graphics, game development, and visualization roles.
